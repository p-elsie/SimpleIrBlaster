  I wanted to use PIN 10, because I have the LED soldered to it already, from a previous use case, with much older code. 
  
  To make pin 10 work, I changed line 199 of PinDefinitionsAndMore.h as follows:

elif defined(TEENSYDUINO)
#define IR_RECEIVE_PIN      2
#define IR_SEND_PIN         13 (line 199)

Tested with Arduino 1.8.19, and IRRemote 3.7.1
